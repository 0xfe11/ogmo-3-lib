# ogmo-3-lib

A Haxe parser for Project and Level files generated by Ogmo Editor 3.

An example of how the library can be used has been included in the `sample` directory, using [Heaps](https://heaps.io) for rendering. Run either `hl.hxml` or `js.hxml` to produce a Hashlink or Javascript build of the sample.
