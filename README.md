# ogmo-3-lib

A Haxe parser for Project and Level files generated by Ogmo Editor 3.

An example of how the library can be used has been included in the `sample` directory, using [Heaps](https://heaps.io) for rendering. Run either `hl.hxml` or `js.hxml` to produce a Hashlink or Javascript build of the sample.

# Getting Started

First, install the Library from haxelib.

```
haxelib install ogmo-3
```

Then in your project, simply use `Project.create()` and `Level.create()` to parse any `.ogmo` Projects or `.json` Levels!

```haxe
// Get the Project and Level files you'd like to parse (as Strings)
var project_text = sys.io.File.getContent('assets/project.ogmo');
var level_text = sys.io.File.getContent('assets/levels/level_1.json');

// Create the Project and Level data from the Text Files
var project = Project.create(project_text);
var level = Level.create(level_text);

trace(project);
trace(level);
```
